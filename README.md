# Delta Robot Actuation Project

*by Lucas Camargo, Soly Waltrick, and Willian Kenji Nishizawa*

This project consists in the development of a driving and control solution for a standard delta robot. It does not concern the development of the robot itself, or its actuators. It focuses on driving the actuators, control mechanisms, and required transducers (sensors).

The deliverables are organized in the following directories:

+ *datasheets* - documentation on different components used in the project
+ *fw* - controller + driver: board firmware
+ *hw* - controller + driver: hardware project
+ *report* - project report
+ *sw* - interface software for interacting with the controller board using a computer

*TODO: insert backref link to post*
